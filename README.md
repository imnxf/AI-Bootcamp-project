Project Title: Sales Data Forecasting Using ARIMA and SARIMA Models
Project Description:
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting sales data using advanced time series models. The process begins with exploring and understanding the sales dataset, followed by cleaning and preparing the data to ensure accuracy before applying predictive models.

Main Steps:
Data Exploration:

Initial inspection of the dataset to understand its structure and key variables affecting sales.

Data Cleaning:

Handling missing or inconsistent values.

Formatting time-related columns for proper time series analysis.

Time Series Analysis:

Identifying trends, seasonality, and patterns in sales over time.

Visualizing the data to gain insights.

Forecasting Models:

Applying the ARIMA model for forecasting sales.

Applying the SARIMA model to account for seasonal effects.

Comparing the performance of both models based on accuracy metrics.

Conclusion:

The ARIMA model outperformed SARIMA in terms of prediction accuracy and was selected as the final forecasting model.
